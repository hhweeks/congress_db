Congress_ERDiagram.pdf -- our current ER diagram created in Mysqlworkbench
createTable.sql -- creates our tables
createLog.txt -- is a log of running createTable on chester
insertData.sql -- inserts our real data (expects a folder import_data)
insertDataLog.txt -- is a log of importing all of our data
import_data.tar.gz -- tarball containing our script transformed data to sql statements
Our data was taken from govtrack.us bulk data

The scripts/ folder contains our files for parsing data to mysql statements.

the scripts expects data to be in the same format as govtrack.us or it may
fail spectacularly.

We parsed into multiple value insert statements, and because 
mysql was crashing on a macbook limited the number of rows inserted
in a statement to 500 at a time for some of the larger tables.

Because of this limitation the insertDataLog.txt is around 25000 lines long

Right now our tables sizes look like:

mysql> SELECT TABLE_NAME, TABLE_ROWS FROM `information_schema`.`tables`
    -> WHERE `table_schema` = 'wortiz';

13 rows in set (0.01 sec)

Apparently this might not be accurate but it appears we meet the requirements of 100,000 entries for some tables.
