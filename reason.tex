We did modify our ER diagram from the original version. We expanded the concept Bill to Bill and Amendment, to encompass more legislation present in our data set. We added attribute fields to several relations to add information that was valuable and nuanced in the data files, such as the distinction between title, popular title, and short title in Bill. We expanded the concept of "vote" to 2 relations, one for the result of a piece of legislation, and one for the vote belonging to an individual legislator.
