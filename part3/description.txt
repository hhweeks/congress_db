2 Modification Queries
======================

  1. If a Legislator does not have a full name update it with their
     wikipedia id (which is a full name) only if their wikipedia id is
     not null as well
     ,----
     | update Legislator 
     | set official_full_name=wikipedia_id 
     | where official_full_name IS NULL and wikipedia_id IS NOT NULL;
     `----

  2. Change a legislators end date for a specific Term (like if they
     have been removed from office, in our case Tom Marino is likely to
     be appointed to another position soon)
     ,----
     | update Term
     | set end = '2017-05-01'
     | where bioguide_id = (select bioguide_id from Legislator 
     | 		     where `First Name` = 'Tom' and `Last Name` = 'Marino') 
     | 		     and end > '2017-05-01';
     `----

  3. Delete all Legislators , Sponsor, and Terms for those legislator if
     they never participated in a vote in our data

     | 
     | delete from Sponsor 
     | where Legislator_id 
     |       not in (select bioguide_id from Legislator_Vote);
     | 
     | delete from Legislator 
     | where bioguide_id 
     |       not in (select bioguide_id from Legislator_Vote);
     `----

  4. Delete all votes that we do not have a record of Legislators voting
     on it
     ,----
     | delete from Vote 
     | where id 
     |       not in (select Vote_id as id from Legislator_Vote);
     `----


  1. Add a new Legislator (a special election has occured and Ron Estes
     needs to be added).
     ,----
     | insert into Legislator (bioguide_id, `Last Name`, `First Name`, 
     |                         birthday, gender, `wikipedia_id`, 
     |                         govtrack_id, official_full_name)     
     | Value     
     | ('E000298', 'Estes', 'Ron', '1956-07-19', 'M', NULL, 412735, NULL);
     `----

  2. Add a new term for that legislator (each legislator should have a
     corresponding Term)
     ,----
     | insert into Term 
     | VALUE ('E000298', '2017-04-27', '2019-01-03', 
     |        'rep', 'KS', NULL, 4, 'Republican', 'h');
     `----


3 Useful Indexes
================

  1. The query where we find all legislators that share a birthday was
     quite slow.  We increased the speed of this dramatically by
     creating an index on their birthday.
     ,----
     | create index bday on Legislator (birthday);
     `----
     From our index log file using this index the query went from 12.58
     sec to 0.07 sec

  2. When finding all pairs of legislators with the same last name speed
     was imporved by adding a index on `Last Name` column
     ,----
     | create index lastName on Legislator (`Last Name`);
     `----
     From our index log file the query went from 6.97 sec to 0.17 sec

  3. When counting unique ways in which legislators have voted the query
     speed was increased by added an index on the corresponding column:
     ,----
     | create index voteindex on Legislator_Vote(how_voted);
     `----
     From our index log file the query went from 1.43 sec to 0.27 sec


4 Modifying data from the last project
======================================

  - For Legislator: First Name, Last name were the same due to an script
    typo.

  - For Term: Party is Unknown for all members.

  - For bill and amendments there are ‘None’ values instead of NULL.

  All of this was fixed in our github repo and in our database:
  [https://github.com/hhweeks/congress_db/]

  Term and Legislator were updated by correcting the script, Bill and
  Amendments were corrected by performing a sed replace on 'None' to
  NULL in the correct sql import files.
